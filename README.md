In this project, I will replicate a study conducted by Stoet et al. in 2013.
The name of the project is "Are women better than men at multi-tasking?"
The study was based on a common conception that women are better in multi-tasking than men. 
Stoet et al.(2013) investigated this topic within an empirical framework.
There were two experiments. 
Experiment 1:
There were 120 women and 120 men participants
A computer based task switching paradigm was used.
Experiment 2:
There were 47 women and 47 men participants.
paper-and-pencil multi tasking tests were used.
Women outperformed men but we should be cautious about making strong generalisations.


The program executes the experiment mentioned above.
It starts with a training session. The training is immediately followed by an experimental session.
The order of the blocks is the same in training and experimental sessions. 
Participants perform first the shape only block, then filling only, and lastly, mixed block.
Neccessary stimuli are in the same folder. 
Hence, it is enought to download the package, go to the directory of the package and write the name of the .py file. 
As soon as you click enter button, the experiment will start.
You need to enter your subject number, of course. 


TO-DO
As one can see, the part where I defined what is the correct and what is the incorrect response is messier than the other parts.
I believe this part can be done cleaner, although I have no idea about how to do it. 
Also, better ideas about how to map stimuli to response can be implemented as well. 
These are two things that I can see my humble beginner perspective. 
I am open to other suggestions if you have any.
