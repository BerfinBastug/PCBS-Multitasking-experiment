In this project, I will replicate a study conducted by Stoet et al. in 2013.
The name of the project is "Are women better than men at multi-tasking?"
The study was based on a common conception that women are better in multi-tasking than men. 
Stoet et al.(2013) investigated this topic within an empirical framework.
There were two experiments. 
Experiment 1:
There were 120 women and 120 men participants
A computer based task switching paradigm was used.
Experiment 2:
There were 47 women and 47 men participants.
paper-and-pencil multi tasking tests were used.
Women outperformed men but we should be cautious about making strong generalisations.
